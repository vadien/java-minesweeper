# Minesweeper in Java

## Requirements / Purpose

- My first Java project: A recreation of the classic game in Java, entirely in the CLI.
- Reinforcing good OOP coding principles and building familiarity with the Java standard library
- Built entirely in Java 21!

---

## Instructions

- Successfully mark all mines to win the game!
- The number of mines is determined by the width of the board.

- You can either CHECK or MARK cells.
- To check a cell, enter the character 'C' followed by the cell you wish to check.
- To mark a cell that contains a mine, enter the character 'M' or 'B' before the cell.
- For example to CHECK the cell A1, enter 'Ca1'. To MARK it as a mine, enter 'Ba1'.
- All inputs are case insensitive.
- Enter 'h' at any time for other instructions.

## Build Steps

- Ensure you have Java JRE 21 installed
- Run App.java within VSCode or your preferred compiler

---

## Design Goals / Approach

- Goal: To enable smooth storage and handling of the game data
- Goal: To build a 'complete' experience with error handling and win/fail states
- Goal: To provide a logical control method for CLI-based input

- To facilitate goals 2 & 3 I implemented the win condition as the player successfully 'marking' all mines. In other versions of the game the player wins by revealing all non-mine cells, however the repeated inputs quickly became tiresome.

---

## Features

- Selectable grid size from 1 - 25 rows
- Included instructions
- Restarting from game over

---

## Known issues

None! ðŸ¥³

---

## Future Goals

- Currently the game uses marking mines as a win condition (to prevent the player having to manually clear each cell one by one). I will update this to also allow victory by revealing all non-mine squares.

---

## Challenges

- Deciding on a cell storage method was probably the largest decision of the project and carried the greatest repercussions. I thought using an ArrayList of single digits was a novel and clever approach, but I still ended up needing a second ArrayList to handle which cells are revealed to the player. If I were to reattempt this challenge I would try to use a more elegant data structure like a HashMap.
